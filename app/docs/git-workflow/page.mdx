# Git workflow

We use the standard [gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for every projects with a few ground rules:
1. We use `master` branch, not `main` branch. 
2. Feature branches always branch off the `develop` branch.
3. Hotfix branches always branch off the `master` branch.
4. Merge frequently to avoid large, complex merge conflicts.



## Frequently Ask Questions
